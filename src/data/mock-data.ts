Agents from Hudyaka\\\'s four classes showcased daunting teamwork, physical prowess, and straining skill in a blend of modern games and traditional Filipino pastimes in a creative and exciting format. Grids flew high as the CCS Fourth Floor became the strategic arena for Agent’s Gambit (Human Checkers), where the Cunning Controllers dominated with impressive coordination and foresight. However, checkmate did not mark the end of Hudyaka\\\'s action: the MSU-IIT Gymnasium buzzed with energy as three more events unfolded.  In a supersized game of skill, Breeze Beach Molly (Big Volleyball), the Intrepid Initiators outplayed their rivals with powerful serves and seamless teamwork to secure the championship title. Meanwhile, the Stalwart Sentinels leaped to victory in Ace the Jump (Chinese Garter), showing incredible balance and flexibility.  Further dominating the playing field, Cunning Controllers proved their versatility by also conquering Radiant Rush (Modified Sack Race), sealing their supremacy across multiple games and claiming the Radiant Motion Overall Championship In every jump, sprint, and strategy, the agents made their mark—securing the site, dominating the game, and staying radiant.

Held on Wednesday, May 7 at the Institute Mini-Theater, the event highlighted multifaceted approaches to literature as a lens for exploring pressing societal issues under the theme: “Dalumat sa mga Rehiyonal na Panitikan: Mga Boses ng Paglaban, Pagpapahayag, at Pag-usbong ng Kultura at Kamalayan sa Pampanitikang Pananaliksik.” Bringing fresh perspectives to the colloquium, five graduating students led the panel critiques—highlighting the next generation of Filipino literary scholars. Providing guidance and critical insights during the scholarly discussions were BA Panitikan fourth-years, Clariza Jane Ovillo, Kayrel Bloom Acero, Michelle Maglinte, Anniefaye Noreen Catarig, and Sarah Piamonte. During the opening remarks, Asst. Prof. Loi Vincent Deriada, PAN116’s course instructor, expressed his heartfelt gratitude, notably mentioning that this marked their fourth iteration of Sukit-Sukit which has persistently endured since the COVID-19 pandemic. He also emphasized the colloquium’s purpose of fostering deeper understanding of both social and academic issues relevant to literary studies. In an interview, Grachele Diangco Gamuzaran, a second-year BA Panitikan student whose research was awarded Best Paper during the colloquium expressed, “Malaki ang ambag ng mga kolokyum tulad ng Sukit-Sukit sa larangan ng pananaliksik. Nagsisilbi itong espasyo kung saan maaaring ilahad at ibahagi ng mga mananaliksik ang kanilang mga pag-aaral, mapakinggan ang puna at mungkahi ng kapwa iskolar, at makabuo ng dayalogo na tumutulay sa iba\\\'t ibang disiplina, wika, at perspektiba. Bukod dito, pinatitibay rin nito ang pagkilala sa mga lokal na panitikan at pananaw na madalas na naisantabi sa mas dominanteng diskurso.” The colloquium presented 16 compelling research papers that demonstrated the students’ rigorous engagement with contemporary literature as both an artistic and a sociopolitical medium. Among the standout presentations were: “Isip na Wasak, Tinig na Boses: Isang Masuring Pagsusuri sa Krisis sa Kalusugang Pangkaisipan Partikular sa Isyung Depresyon sa Akdang ‘Siya si Ril’ ni Hannah A. Leceña” by Angel Johanna Jalaman, April Kris Puasa, and Leonisa Ramos, which examined mental health crises. Intriguingly, there was also “Metapora ng Lipunang Pilipino: Ang Pananamantala, Panlilinlang, at Pang-aabuso sa Alamat ng Gubat ni Bob Ong Bilang Repleksyon ng Tunay na Kalagayan ng Pilipinas” by Viremi Antivo, Cathlene Orida, Cristen Jane Progella, and Edrian Larano, which was a critical analysis of Bob Ong’s allegory about the dire political state of the national scene. Exploring the timeless lesson of “‘Sandaang Damit’ ni Fanny A. Garcia: Materyalismo Bilang Panlipunang Pagtanggap”, Grant Adian Castillo, Jeanwin Quidlat, and Joshua Catamco pioneered the paper. Collectively, these works—along with those unmentioned—underscored the vitality of regional voices in confronting contemporary issues, ranging from cultural preservation to identity politics, all while pushing the boundaries of literary research and methodology. Despite all that, however, only three papers were honored as Best Papers in the colloquium.

    content: '𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝗰 𝗼𝗳 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝘆𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗱 𝗥𝗼𝗴𝘂𝗲𝘀: 𝗗𝘆𝗻𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗰𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘆 "Pilay hatag sa pikas? Pilay nadawat nimo? Pilay backing?"  Yesterday, May 12, 2025, millions of Filipinos trudged to the polls, a ritual meant to solidify democracy. Yet, the reported 2.74% of vote-buying violations nationwide—a mere sliver of the actual, insidious reality—casts a long, dark shadow.  Reported cases, sealed envelopes, sample ballots masquerading as currency, a grotesque mockery of electoral integrity. How many more clandestine transactions remain hidden, silently eroding the very foundation of our governance? It’s a bitter truth: genuine service, the bedrock of true leadership, is drowned out by the cacophony of cash. When votes are bought, principles are sold, and the machinery of good governance grinds to a halt. This is not politics; it\\\'s a parasitic infection, a shameless violation of our constitutional compact. Still counting your blood money? We\\\'ve never seen Filipinos so complacent to normalize vote-buying, to the point where even youth voters gloat over the backing—a form of time-limited cash release given to those who cast their votes before 9am—hampering not only an orderly flow of voters but also hindering seniors who are exiting from the early voting hours.  We rage against the rampant corruption, the systemic rot that plagues our nation, yet we willingly trade our votes for fleeting monetary trinkets, especially in the local polls.  We might rejoice at such a high vote turnout, not knowing that citizens were incentivized to vote not on their platforms but on the amount of money that they spend on each voter—augmented with their name on a sample ballot stapled with thousands of pesos.  The winning formula is no longer guns, goons and gold. It\\\'s sayaw, ayuda and fake news. No longer is there an exposition of policies, but a living auction of human rights for simple aid or subsistence, building branding instead of service, and exacerbating the age-old problem of vote buying in the country: a practice that has perpetuated political dynasties because of an incumbency advantage.  We exchange the promise of progress for pixelated illusions, hollow pledges that evaporate like volatile solvents under the harsh light of reality. Our minds, once sharp and discerning, are now chloroformed by the seductive allure of personality politics, and the familiar names of political dynasties. Consider this: are we truly assessing the legislative prowess of these candidates? Can they draft laws with precision, manage budgets with prudence, negotiate international treaties with sagacity, or are we merely swayed by the loudest voices, the most lavish handouts, or the inherited power of a surname? Sadly, the 2025 local elections have seen various local candidacies where multi-awarded leaders have been turned down by many voters simply because they offered less "cash incentives" than the opposing party. Vote buying persists, a viral contagion, and the highest bidder wins, regardless of competence or integrity.  We\\\'ve resurrected the political undead: dynasties that cling to power like kudzu, choking the life out of progress. We\\\'ve crowned heirs to thrones they haven\\\'t earned, where surnames outweigh substance, and bloodlines trump brains. We\\\'ve installed puppets who can\\\'t string a coherent sentence without a script, their words as hollow as their promises. Platforms, once beacons of hope, gather dust, their promises forgotten in the cacophony of the circus. Track records, the empirical evidence of a candidate\\\'s capability, are discarded like obsolete scientific data. We cry out against corruption, incompetence and stagnation, yet we perpetuate the very cycle that breeds them. We rage against the system, yet we refuse to recalibrate our engagement with it, clinging to the familiar comfort of self-sabotage. We’ve rolled out the red carpet for celebrities seeking a cushy retirement gig, treating public office like a golden parachute. We\\\'ve legitimized ex-convicts, their past transgressions brushed aside like inconvenient dust.  We’ve elevated those whose academic credentials wouldn’t qualify them to run a lemonade stand, let alone a nation. We\\\'ve offered seats of power to those with baggage so heavy, it threatens to collapse the very institutions they are supposed to uphold. Would you entrust your life to a surgeon who boasts of kindness but lacks the fundamental skill to wield a scalpel?  No, you wouldn’t. Then why, in the name of reason, do we allow incompetent candidates—those with inherited titles, those who can\\\'t speak without a script, those who treat public office as a retirement plan—to occupy positions of power, granting them six-figure salaries while they dismantle the very fabric of our society? We have allowed ourselves to be emotionally titrated, distracted by the ephemeral allure of 5k or 10k, oblivious to the long-term devastation it wreaks. Will that sum sustain you for the next three or six years? Or will it merely serve as a down payment on our collective ruin?  Next presidential election, where vote buying is expected to rise higher, promise us to  break this cycle, to dismantle this corrupt system, and to build a future where integrity outweighs any bribe. We are a nation addicted to our own dysfunction, a republic of recycled rogues. The blood money is counted. But the blood of our nation is also being spilled. What will be our choice?

The BSCE program also emerged as the second most preferred program in the entire university, following BS Nursing. The BS Civil Engineering program has consistently been a top choice for aspiring IITians. This year, the program attracted a significant number of applicants, with 1913 hopefuls vying for a slot. Historically, the program could only accommodate around 40 students. However, MSU-IIT has recently expanded its capacity, with approximately 80 CE freshmen admitted for the current academic year. Further highlighting the university\\\'s academic excellence, the SASE 2025 results also showed that out of the 264 SASE topnotchers, 153 chose to enroll at MSU-IIT. MSU-IIT\\\'s overall popularity among students is evident in the SASE taker preferences. A remarkable 16,220 examinees indicated MSU-IIT as their preferred campus, making it the most preferred campus among the MSU system, based on the SASE 2025 data.

Featuring booths representing Korea, Sri Lanka, Russia, Kazakhstan, Palestine, and Thailand, the event held at the CASS New Lobby combined educational displays with interactive games and traditional attires.  Charlene Jessa Delos Angeles, a Panitikan student representing the Sri Lanka booth, explained the event’s concept: “Each group picked one Asian country to showcase, not just its food, but also its history and culture,” she said. “For example, I’m the icon for Sri Lanka, so I wore a sari-inspired outfit.” Each kiosk offered attendees a unique cultural experience with videos, infographics, and games such as quiz bowls, mini games, and even karaoke; the exhibit aimed to offer both cultural insight and stress relief through a fun, immersive experience—timed perfectly during finals week. “Our goal is to make learning fun—to make learning about Asia fun and entertaining,” Delos Angeles added.

Held on April 28, 2025, at the university gymnasium, the event saw students proudly don hard hats, symbolizing their focused gaze on the future. Department of Civil Engineering and Technology (CET) chairperson, Dr. Elizabeth Albiento, underscored the importance of the occasion, describing the ceremony as the "passage into your professional role." She emphasized that this event not only represented a culmination of their academic endeavors but also signified the readiness of the 42 CET students to actively participate in the creation of vital infrastructure that shapes their community through building and innovation. The act of hard hatting and pinning served as a tangible testament to the students\\\' dedication, perseverance, and diligent effort within the construction field. Guest speaker Jyl Honey Muleta eloquently pointed out that this milestone embodied readiness, responsibility, and resilience. "Today isn’t just about hard hatting. Today is all about stepping to your calling. Wearing a hard hat is more than just a safety gear, it’s a symbol, a badge of responsibility. A reminder that the infrastructure we built, shaped life," she affirmed. Acknowledging a potential challenge, Muleta addressed the reality that CET graduates might encounter distinctions regarding their professional title compared to those holding a Bachelor of Science degree. She recognized that this could lead to disheartening remarks, such as "Dili mana siya engineer, nganong maminaw man ko sa iya?," potentially testing their self-assurance. In response, she urged the graduates to let their accomplishments be their primary form of communication, advising them to pause, take a breath, and allow their actions to speak volumes. Muleta passionately encouraged the CET students to embrace their program with pride, emphasizing that their worthiness would be demonstrated through their capabilities rather than solely by a title. She concluded this thought with an empowering message: "Wear that hard hat with pride, stay grounded, stay focused, and build boldly." The ceremony also included a poignant tribute to the unwavering support systems of the students. During this heartfelt moment, the graduates sang “Thanks to You” while presenting their parents and guardians with roses, symbolizing their deep gratitude and love. This was followed by a powerful and proud rendition of the community song “Here I Am,” celebrating the graduates\\\' well-deserved achievement. Batch top 1 Irish Mondares encapsulated the determined spirit of this pioneering class as they prepared to embark on their professional paths, stating, “In a world full of kapoy, be that pandayon kay naa tay pangandoy." With hard hats now firmly in place and pins displayed with pride, these students stand ready to transition into the practical world of the construction industry. Dr. Pamela Resurreccion, Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, brought the ceremony to a close with words that offered enduring guidance: “Wear your hard hats with pride, wear your pins with purpose, and move forward. You are ready." Report by Angel Faith Mirayo Photos by Jay-Em Balbuena and Rey Joaquin Eva #TheThuumPublication   #AccentuatingCoherenceOneWordAtATime',
