This outstanding achievement significantly exceeded the national average of 75.34%. This examination marked a new milestone as it was the first time the CHELE was administered in a computer-based format, mirroring the setup used for the Metallurgical Engineering Licensure Examination. All seven first-time takers from MSU-IIT successfully passed the exam, securing a perfect 100% passing rate for new examinees. Furthermore, one previous examinee from the university also passed, contributing to a total of eight newly licensed chemical engineers from MSU-IIT. The May 2025 CHELE, held from May 21-23, 2025, saw 602 successful examinees out of 799 who participated from various institutions nationwide. The Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) officially released these results today, May 23, 2025. #TheThuumPublication #AccentuatingCoherenceOneWordAtATime',

The BSCE program also emerged as the second most preferred program in the entire university, following BS Nursing. The BS Civil Engineering program has consistently been a top choice for aspiring IITians. This year, the program attracted a significant number of applicants, with 1913 hopefuls vying for a slot. Historically, the program could only accommodate around 40 students. However, MSU-IIT has recently expanded its capacity, with approximately 80 CE freshmen admitted for the current academic year. Further highlighting the university\\\'s academic excellence, the SASE 2025 results also showed that out of the 264 SASE topnotchers, 153 chose to enroll at MSU-IIT. MSU-IIT\\\'s overall popularity among students is evident in the SASE taker preferences. A remarkable 16,220 examinees indicated MSU-IIT as their preferred campus, making it the most preferred campus among the MSU system, based on the SASE 2025 data.

Held on April 28, 2025, at the university gymnasium, the event saw students proudly don hard hats, symbolizing their focused gaze on the future. Department of Civil Engineering and Technology (CET) chairperson, Dr. Elizabeth Albiento, underscored the importance of the occasion, describing the ceremony as the "passage into your professional role." She emphasized that this event not only represented a culmination of their academic endeavors but also signified the readiness of the 42 CET students to actively participate in the creation of vital infrastructure that shapes their community through building and innovation. The act of hard hatting and pinning served as a tangible testament to the students\\\' dedication, perseverance, and diligent effort within the construction field. Guest speaker Jyl Honey Muleta eloquently pointed out that this milestone embodied readiness, responsibility, and resilience. "Today isn’t just about hard hatting. Today is all about stepping to your calling. Wearing a hard hat is more than just a safety gear, it’s a symbol, a badge of responsibility. A reminder that the infrastructure we built, shaped life," she affirmed. Acknowledging a potential challenge, Muleta addressed the reality that CET graduates might encounter distinctions regarding their professional title compared to those holding a Bachelor of Science degree. She recognized that this could lead to disheartening remarks, such as "Dili mana siya engineer, nganong maminaw man ko sa iya?," potentially testing their self-assurance. In response, she urged the graduates to let their accomplishments be their primary form of communication, advising them to pause, take a breath, and allow their actions to speak volumes. Muleta passionately encouraged the CET students to embrace their program with pride, emphasizing that their worthiness would be demonstrated through their capabilities rather than solely by a title. She concluded this thought with an empowering message: "Wear that hard hat with pride, stay grounded, stay focused, and build boldly." The ceremony also included a poignant tribute to the unwavering support systems of the students. During this heartfelt moment, the graduates sang “Thanks to You” while presenting their parents and guardians with roses, symbolizing their deep gratitude and love. This was followed by a powerful and proud rendition of the community song “Here I Am,” celebrating the graduates\\\' well-deserved achievement. Batch top 1 Irish Mondares encapsulated the determined spirit of this pioneering class as they prepared to embark on their professional paths, stating, “In a world full of kapoy, be that pandayon kay naa tay pangandoy." With hard hats now firmly in place and pins displayed with pride, these students stand ready to transition into the practical world of the construction industry. Dr. Pamela Resurreccion, Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, brought the ceremony to a close with words that offered enduring guidance: “Wear your hard hats with pride, wear your pins with purpose, and move forward. You are ready." Report by Angel Faith Mirayo Photos by Jay-Em Balbuena and Rey Joaquin Eva #TheThuumPublication   #AccentuatingCoherenceOneWordAtATime',
