Ambolode, a fully funded Erasmus+ Mobility Program awardee from the Department of Physics, is currently making waves at the prestigious Institut de Recherche sur les Céramiques (IRCER) in Limoges, France. There, he is immersed in cutting-edge research: the synthesis of ultrafine metal oxide powders via spray pyrolysis, with profound implications for dielectric and optical applications. This international mobility opportunity, generously made possible through Erasmus+ funding, underscores MSU-IIT’s unwavering commitment to advancing scientific excellence and fostering global collaboration. It represents a significant stride in bringing Filipino brilliance to the forefront of the international scientific community. As the Academic Year 2025-2026 rapidly approaches, this achievement also serves as a powerful testament to the opportunities awaiting aspiring scientists. According to Prof. Beverly Gemao from the Department of Physics, the boundless possibilities are clear for future scholars. "If you\\\'re an incoming freshman with a strong interest in math and the sciences, we warmly encourage you to consider the BS Physics program... Physics is often called the foundation of science because it connects naturally with many fields... giving you a wide range of options for future research or career paths. Many of our students also benefit from sponsored internships and sandwich programs with partner institutions abroad, offering valuable global experience in both academics and research." Furthering her post in the public forum ‘MSU-IIT Cats’, Prof Gemao alo encouraged incoming freshies to see physics as a field of specialized opportunities. “The BS Physics program further ensures that by your third year, you\\\'ll delve into diverse, impactful research areas such as medical and radiation physics, biophysics and soft matter, particle physics, theoretical and computational physics, nanoscience, materials science, and many others, allowing you to grow and specialize based on your passion.” she adds.

The event’s competitive format split scholars into four teams based on Valorant agent roles—Controllers, Sentinels,  Initiators, and Duelists—each bringing their own flair to the stage.  The Cunning Controllers, cloaked in violet valor, emerged victorious in the final tally—besting four rival classes in a display of sheer teamwork and sustained momentum. Meanwhile, the Stalwart Sentinels stood their ground in second, with the Intrepid Initiators and Dashing Duelists finishing strong. In the same celebration, Roselle Tingcang of the Stalwart Sentinels, donning the likeness the agent, Sage, was named Midsa Icon 2025. Her platform, calling for an abuse-free world led by gender-sensitive patriot scholars, resonated with the audience and judges alike. During the awarding ceremony, Stiven Merca, captain of the winning Cunning Controllers, reflected on the importance of presence and perseverance throughout the camp’s many challenges. “My most important lesson about being a captain is always showing up—that is why I appreciate my fellow class members who showed up with me, who participated in the events this Hudyaka 2025,” MIDSA President Aiman Mosot wrapped up the event with heartfelt final words, acknowledging the operational challenges faced—academic pressures, reschedules, and the strain of time—but also the resilience that triumphed in the end. “Despite a lot of hurdles—conflicting schedules, academic pressure, and personal struggles—we continue to succeed, persevere, and celebrate a blast for Dasig Midsa 2025,” he shared. As the dust settled and the banners were folded, one thing became clear: Hudyaka 2025 wasn’t just a spectacle. It was a mission accomplished. Operation Status: Complete.  Legacy: Ongoing.

Agents from Hudyaka\\\'s four classes showcased daunting teamwork, physical prowess, and straining skill in a blend of modern games and traditional Filipino pastimes in a creative and exciting format. Grids flew high as the CCS Fourth Floor became the strategic arena for Agent’s Gambit (Human Checkers), where the Cunning Controllers dominated with impressive coordination and foresight. However, checkmate did not mark the end of Hudyaka\\\'s action: the MSU-IIT Gymnasium buzzed with energy as three more events unfolded.  In a supersized game of skill, Breeze Beach Molly (Big Volleyball), the Intrepid Initiators outplayed their rivals with powerful serves and seamless teamwork to secure the championship title. Meanwhile, the Stalwart Sentinels leaped to victory in Ace the Jump (Chinese Garter), showing incredible balance and flexibility.  Further dominating the playing field, Cunning Controllers proved their versatility by also conquering Radiant Rush (Modified Sack Race), sealing their supremacy across multiple games and claiming the Radiant Motion Overall Championship In every jump, sprint, and strategy, the agents made their mark—securing the site, dominating the game, and staying radiant.

Yesterday, May 12, 2025, millions of Filipinos trudged to the polls, a ritual meant to solidify democracy. Yet, the reported 2.74% of vote-buying violations nationwide—a mere sliver of the actual, insidious reality—casts a long, dark shadow.  Reported cases, sealed envelopes, sample ballots masquerading as currency, a grotesque mockery of electoral integrity. How many more clandestine transactions remain hidden, silently eroding the very foundation of our governance? It’s a bitter truth: genuine service, the bedrock of true leadership, is drowned out by the cacophony of cash. When votes are bought, principles are sold, and the machinery of good governance grinds to a halt. This is not politics; it\\\'s a parasitic infection, a shameless violation of our constitutional compact. Still counting your blood money? We\\\'ve never seen Filipinos so complacent to normalize vote-buying, to the point where even youth voters gloat over the backing—a form of time-limited cash release given to those who cast their votes before 9am—hampering not only an orderly flow of voters but also hindering seniors who are exiting from the early voting hours.  We rage against the rampant corruption, the systemic rot that plagues our nation, yet we willingly trade our votes for fleeting monetary trinkets, especially in the local polls.  We might rejoice at such a high vote turnout, not knowing that citizens were incentivized to vote not on their platforms but on the amount of money that they spend on each voter—augmented with their name on a sample ballot stapled with thousands of pesos.  The winning formula is no longer guns, goons and gold. It\\\'s sayaw, ayuda and fake news. No longer is there an exposition of policies, but a living auction of human rights for simple aid or subsistence, building branding instead of service, and exacerbating the age-old problem of vote buying in the country: a practice that has perpetuated political dynasties because of an incumbency advantage.  We exchange the promise of progress for pixelated illusions, hollow pledges that evaporate like volatile solvents under the harsh light of reality. Our minds, once sharp and discerning, are now chloroformed by the seductive allure of personality politics, and the familiar names of political dynasties. Consider this: are we truly assessing the legislative prowess of these candidates? Can they draft laws with precision, manage budgets with prudence, negotiate international treaties with sagacity, or are we merely swayed by the loudest voices, the most lavish handouts, or the inherited power of a surname? Sadly, the 2025 local elections have seen various local candidacies where multi-awarded leaders have been turned down by many voters simply because they offered less "cash incentives" than the opposing party. Vote buying persists, a viral contagion, and the highest bidder wins, regardless of competence or integrity.  We\\\'ve resurrected the political undead: dynasties that cling to power like kudzu, choking the life out of progress. We\\\'ve crowned heirs to thrones they haven\\\'t earned, where surnames outweigh substance, and bloodlines trump brains. We\\\'ve installed puppets who can\\\'t string a coherent sentence without a script, their words as hollow as their promises. Platforms, once beacons of hope, gather dust, their promises forgotten in the cacophony of the circus. Track records, the empirical evidence of a candidate\\\'s capability, are discarded like obsolete scientific data. We cry out against corruption, incompetence and stagnation, yet we perpetuate the very cycle that breeds them. We rage against the system, yet we refuse to recalibrate our engagement with it, clinging to the familiar comfort of self-sabotage. We’ve rolled out the red carpet for celebrities seeking a cushy retirement gig, treating public office like a golden parachute. We\\\'ve legitimized ex-convicts, their past transgressions brushed aside like inconvenient dust.  We’ve elevated those whose academic credentials wouldn’t qualify them to run a lemonade stand, let alone a nation. We\\\'ve offered seats of power to those with baggage so heavy, it threatens to collapse the very institutions they are supposed to uphold. Would you entrust your life to a surgeon who boasts of kindness but lacks the fundamental skill to wield a scalpel?  No, you wouldn’t. Then why, in the name of reason, do we allow incompetent candidates—those with inherited titles, those who can\\\'t speak without a script, those who treat public office as a retirement plan—to occupy positions of power, granting them six-figure salaries while they dismantle the very fabric of our society? We have allowed ourselves to be emotionally titrated, distracted by the ephemeral allure of 5k or 10k, oblivious to the long-term devastation it wreaks. Will that sum sustain you for the next three or six years? Or will it merely serve as a down payment on our collective ruin?  Next presidential election, where vote buying is expected to rise higher, promise us to  break this cycle, to dismantle this corrupt system, and to build a future where integrity outweighs any bribe. We are a nation addicted to our own dysfunction, a republic of recycled rogues. The blood money is counted. But the blood of our nation is also being spilled. What will be our choice?

The BSCE program also emerged as the second most preferred program in the entire university, following BS Nursing. The BS Civil Engineering program has consistently been a top choice for aspiring IITians. This year, the program attracted a significant number of applicants, with 1913 hopefuls vying for a slot. Historically, the program could only accommodate around 40 students. However, MSU-IIT has recently expanded its capacity, with approximately 80 CE freshmen admitted for the current academic year. Further highlighting the university\\\'s academic excellence, the SASE 2025 results also showed that out of the 264 SASE topnotchers, 153 chose to enroll at MSU-IIT. MSU-IIT\\\'s overall popularity among students is evident in the SASE taker preferences. A remarkable 16,220 examinees indicated MSU-IIT as their preferred campus, making it the most preferred campus among the MSU system, based on the SASE 2025 data.

    content: '𝐂𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐥 𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐬 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐲 The Civil Engineering Technology (CET) students of Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology (MSU-IIT) marked a significant milestone in their academic and professional journeys with their inaugural Hard Hatting and Pinning Ceremony. Held on April 28, 2025, at the university gymnasium, the event saw students proudly don hard hats, symbolizing their focused gaze on the future. Department of Civil Engineering and Technology (CET) chairperson, Dr. Elizabeth Albiento, underscored the importance of the occasion, describing the ceremony as the "passage into your professional role." She emphasized that this event not only represented a culmination of their academic endeavors but also signified the readiness of the 42 CET students to actively participate in the creation of vital infrastructure that shapes their community through building and innovation. The act of hard hatting and pinning served as a tangible testament to the students\\\' dedication, perseverance, and diligent effort within the construction field. Guest speaker Jyl Honey Muleta eloquently pointed out that this milestone embodied readiness, responsibility, and resilience. "Today isn’t just about hard hatting. Today is all about stepping to your calling. Wearing a hard hat is more than just a safety gear, it’s a symbol, a badge of responsibility. A reminder that the infrastructure we built, shaped life," she affirmed. Acknowledging a potential challenge, Muleta addressed the reality that CET graduates might encounter distinctions regarding their professional title compared to those holding a Bachelor of Science degree. She recognized that this could lead to disheartening remarks, such as "Dili mana siya engineer, nganong maminaw man ko sa iya?," potentially testing their self-assurance. In response, she urged the graduates to let their accomplishments be their primary form of communication, advising them to pause, take a breath, and allow their actions to speak volumes. Muleta passionately encouraged the CET students to embrace their program with pride, emphasizing that their worthiness would be demonstrated through their capabilities rather than solely by a title. She concluded this thought with an empowering message: "Wear that hard hat with pride, stay grounded, stay focused, and build boldly." The ceremony also included a poignant tribute to the unwavering support systems of the students. During this heartfelt moment, the graduates sang “Thanks to You” while presenting their parents and guardians with roses, symbolizing their deep gratitude and love. This was followed by a powerful and proud rendition of the community song “Here I Am,” celebrating the graduates\\\' well-deserved achievement. Batch top 1 Irish Mondares encapsulated the determined spirit of this pioneering class as they prepared to embark on their professional paths, stating, “In a world full of kapoy, be that pandayon kay naa tay pangandoy." With hard hats now firmly in place and pins displayed with pride, these students stand ready to transition into the practical world of the construction industry. Dr. Pamela Resurreccion, Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, brought the ceremony to a close with words that offered enduring guidance: “Wear your hard hats with pride, wear your pins with purpose, and move forward. You are ready." Report by Angel Faith Mirayo Photos by Jay-Em Balbuena and Rey Joaquin Eva #TheThuumPublication   #AccentuatingCoherenceOneWordAtATime',
